<h1>Online ShoppingCart Tracker</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The Online Shopping Cart project simulates a basic shopping cart system where users can add items to their cart and view the total price of the items. The project is implemented using Python and consists of two classes: 'Item' and 'Cart'.

The 'Item' class represents an item in the store and has attributes such as item_id, name, brand, and price. It provides a simple initialization method to set these attributes.

The 'Cart' class represents the shopping cart and has a list to store the items. It provides methods to add and remove items from the cart, calculate the total price of the items in the cart, and retrieve the number of items in the cart.

The main part of the code sets up some sample items using the 'Item' class and initializes an empty cart using the 'Cart' class. It then displays the available items to the user and prompts for input to add items to the cart. The user can input the item number to add an item to the cart, and the program handles invalid inputs gracefully. Once the user finishes adding items, the program displays the items in the cart, along with the total number of items and the total price.

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods. It showcases how these concepts can be utilized to create a simple yet functional shopping cart system. The code can be extended and modified to include additional features such as removing items, calculating discounts, and processing payments, making it suitable as a starting point for a more comprehensive online shopping application.
